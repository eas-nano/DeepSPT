# DeepSPT
## Deep Learning Assisted Analysis of Single Particle Tracking for Automated Correlation Between Diffusion and Function
DeepSPT, a deep learning framework to interpret the diffusional 2D or 3D temporal behavior of objects in a rapid and efficient manner, agnostically. DeepSPT is a deep learning framework, encompassing three sequentially connected modules: A temporal behavior segmentation module; a diffusional fingerprinting module; and a task-specific downstream classifier module (Fig. 1a). The first two modules are universal, applicable directly to any trajectory dataset characterized by x, y, (z) and t coordinates across diverse biological systems. The final module capitalizes on experimental data to learn a task that is specific to the system under investigation.

### Usage
#### Installation
DeepSPT's installation guide utilize conda environment setup, therefore either miniconda or anaconda is required to follow the bellow installation guide.
 - Anaconda install guide: [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
 - Mini conda install guide: [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

DeepSPT is most easily setup in a new conda environment with dependecies, versions, and channels found in environment_droplet.yml or DeepSPT_simple.yml for a simple version of the environemnt file - Open Terminal / Commando prompt at wished location of DeepSPT and run the bash commands below, which creates the environemnt, downloades and installs packages, typically in less than 5 minutes. The code has been tested both on MacOS and Linux operating systems.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:JKaestelHansen/DeepSPT.git OR git clone https://github.com/JKaestelHansen/DeepSPT (potentially substitute JKaestelHansen with hatzakislab
cd DeepSPT
conda env create -f environment_droplet.yml 
conda activate DeepSPT
pip install probfit==1.2.0
pip install iminuit==2.11.0

As second option:
git clone git@github.com:JKaestelHansen/DeepSPT.git OR git clone https://github.com/JKaestelHansen/DeepSPT (potentially substitute JKaestelHansen with hatzakislab
cd DeepSPT
conda env create -f environment_droplet_minimal.yml
conda activate simpleDeepSPT
pip install h5py==2.10.0
pip install imagecodecs==2023.3.16
pip install pomegranate==0.14.8
pip install probfit==1.2.0
pip install iminuit==2.11.0

Note Windows 11 users may need to relax tensorflow-io-gcs-filesystem to require no version

As third option (Thanks to Konstantinos Tsolakidis for contributing approach):
Especially if running this on an Apple Macbook - M1/M2/M3 processor:

git clone git@github.com:JKaestelHansen/DeepSPT.git OR git clone https://github.com/JKaestelHansen/DeepSPT (potentially substitute JKaestelHansen with hatzakislab
cd DeepSPT

conda env create -f DeepSPT_simple.yml 
conda activate DeepSPT
pip install probfit==1.2.0
pip install iminuit==2.11.0

As fourth option (Thanks to Konstantinos Tsolakidis for contributing approach):
Especially if running this on an Apple Macbook - M1/M2/M3 processor:

git clone git@github.com:JKaestelHansen/DeepSPT.git OR git clone https://github.com/JKaestelHansen/DeepSPT (potentially substitute JKaestelHansen with hatzakislab
cd DeepSPT

conda create --name simpleDeepSPT
conda activate simpleDeepSPT
conda install pip

brew install HDF5 (install brew and update path, instructions here: "https://brew.sh/")
(if the above command gives you an issue, run "arch -arm64 brew install hdf5")
export HDF5_DIR=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/hdf5/(1.12.0_4 or your version)
OR 
export HDF5_DIR=/opt/homebrew/opt/hdf5 (if hdf5 is installed in the "/opt/homebrew/opt/hdf5" location, you have to check it out first)
pip install --no-binary=h5py h5py

conda env update --file environment_droplet_minimal.yml

pip install csbdeep==0.7.4
pip install cython==0.29.37
conda install imagecodecs==2023.1.23
pip install pomegranate==0.14.9
pip install probfit==1.2.0
pip install iminuit==2.11.0

Note Windows 11 users may need to relax tensorflow-io-gcs-filesystem to require no version


```
DeepSPT modules and additional/helpful functions are contained in the `deepspt_src` folder.
When running/building scripts in the DeepSPT directory modules are imported as:
```python
from deepspt_src import *

```
Three test python scripts are provided:
  - `simulate_diffusion.py` - Data generation of 2D or 3D diffusion of heterogeneous/homogeneous motion.
  - `usage_example0.py` - Usage example for loading numpy array saved as pickle or csv file.
  - `usage_example1.py` - Usage example for the three DeepSPT modules: Temporal segmentation, diffusional fingerprinting and task-specific classifier module on simulated data. This code transforms trajectories by temporal segmentation of diffusion and provide diffusional fingerprints to generate feature representation of trajectories both in the form of NumPy arrays. Runtime depends on dataset size but runs in less than 10 minutes for typical data volumes.
  - `usage_example2.py` - Usage example for the three DeepSPT modules: Temporal segmentation, diffusional fingerprinting and task-specific classifier module for time-resolved classification on simulated data. This code transforms trajectories by temporal segmentation of diffusion and provide diffusional fingerprints both in a temporal manner and returns the representations in the form of NumPy arrays. Runtime depends on dataset size but runs in less than 10 minutes for typical data volumes.

### For demostration
For demostration regarding presented data and analysis contained in the manuscript, please refer to the `_For_publication` folder where you will find the required information and scripts. To run on the same data download the data as outlined below.

### Data
  - Your own: DeepSPT accepts csv files or numpy arrays of shape (number of tracks, x,y,(z)). The csv files should contain columns named ['x', 'y', 'z', 'particle', 'frame']. Where 'x','y','z' represent coordinates, 'particle' represents particle id (number) and frame represents timepoint (number). The order is not of major importance. For 2D usecases 'z' column should not be included. The numpy arrays inputed as pickle files should have the shape (number of tracks, length of track, 5 or 4) 5 (particle id, frame, x, y, z) for 3D cases and 4 (particle id, frame, x, y) for 2D cases
  - Simulated data: simulate_diffusion.py, usage_example.py, and usage_example2.py (WIP) contains functions to simulate trajectories.
  - To access data of the publication "Deep learning assisted Single Particle Tracking for automated correlation between diffusion and function" please download from: TBA. Please extract .zip files in place of folders with the same names.
